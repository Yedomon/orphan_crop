[Barker et al 2009](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/doi/10.1093/gbe/evp040/602691?login=true) | polyploidy | Brassicales | Cleome | Arabidopsis| transcriptome

> Analysis of these Cleome data with homologous sequences from other Rosid genomes (Arabidopsis, Carica, Gossypium, Populus, and Vitis) yielded three major findings: 

- **1) confirmation of a Cleome-specific paleopolyploidization (Cs-α) that is independent of the Brassicaceae At-α paleopolyploidization;** 
- **2) Cleome and Arabidopsis share the At-β duplication, which is lacking from papaya within the Brassicales; and**
- **3) rates of molecular evolution are faster for the herbaceous annual taxa Arabidopsis and Cleome than the other predominantly woody perennial Rosid lineages. 

> These findings contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of genome duplication and evolution within one of the most comprehensively surveyed clades of plants, the Rosids, and clarify the complex history of the At-α, At-β, and At-γ duplications of Arabidopsis.**

- Belongs to the **NAD-ME C4 photosynthesis sub-type**
- Uses **NAD-malic enzyme type C4 photosynthesis**
- The family Cleomaceae is relatively **close to Brassicaceae** with Arabidopsis thaliana (a C3 photosynthetic plant) and therefore offers comparison with this well studied model organism.

# Synsepalum dulcificum (Schumach & Thonn.) Daniell 

- #### [Phenotypic variation, functional traits repeatability and core collection inference in Synsepalum dulcificum (Schumach & Thonn.) Daniell reveals the Dahomey Gap as a centre of diversity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76103-4)


[Complete chloroplast genome of Synsepalum dulcificum D.: a magical plant that modifies sour flavors to sweet](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23802359.2020.1798299#:~:text=Synsepalum%20dulcificum%20D.,-belongs%20to%20the&text=dulcificum%20is%20158%2C463bp%2C%20the,were%20annotated%20in%20the%20S.)



> Synsepalum dulcificum D. belongs to the Sapotaceae family (Shi et al. 2016), commonly known as miracle berry, miracle fruit, magic fruit, miraculous or asaba (Coronel et al. 2009; Obafemi et al. 2017), which is an evergreen shrub native to tropical West Africa (Wang et al. 2011). It is a kind of magical plant that has the unique characteristic of modifying sour flavors to sweet (Du et al. 2014). It is also a well-known natural source of ‘miraculin,’ a sweetening glycoprotein (Tchokponhoue et al. 2019). All plant parts of S. dulcificum are of medicinal importance. The berry fruit and leaf contains many nutrients along with many beneficial characteristics (Nkwocha et al. 2014; Njoku et al. 2015). It has the ability to improve insulin sensitivity, and antioxidant and anticancer abilities (Swamy et al. 2014). Thus, it may be used as an adjuvant for treating diabetic patients with insulin resistance (Chen et al. 2006; Obafemi et al. 2017). The seed oil of S. dulcificum is also a rare and exotic fruit oil (Guney and Nawar 1977).
As a valuable plant species, currently, S. dulcificum is utilized in cosmetics and food. Besides, it is also used extensively in the pharmaceutical industry (Achigan-Dako et al. 2015). Surprisingly, there are few studies on the genomics of S. dulcificum, focusing on the nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplast genome, which severely limits its utilization and breeding. In this study, the chloroplast genome of S. dulcificum was sequenced, assembled, and annotated firstly.

- #### [Yield and miraculin content of nine miracle fruit (Synsepalum Dulcificum) morphotypes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10681-020-02710-x)


> Miracle fruit (Synsepalum dulcificum) is an understudied tropical fruit species with potential as a source of natural, non-caloric sweetener. Miracle fruit berries have been consumed in Africa for over 100 years. The fruit pulp contains a protein called miraculin, a natural, non-caloric sweetener, that changes the perception of sour foods and beverages to sweet. Demand for natural, non-caloric sweeteners like miraculin is increasing due to the growing number of people affected by chronic diseases associated with high sugar consumption. Miracle fruit could play a role in reducing sugar content in some food and beverage applications, but basic plant yield data and miraculin content in the fruit is generally lacking.

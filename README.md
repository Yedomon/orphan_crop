[Barker et al 2009](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/doi/10.1093/gbe/evp040/602691?login=true) | polyploidy | Brassicales | Cleome | Arabidopsis| transcriptome

> Analysis of these Cleome data with homologous sequences from other Rosid genomes (Arabidopsis, Carica, Gossypium, Populus, and Vitis) yielded three major findings: 

- **1) confirmation of a Cleome-specific paleopolyploidization (Cs-α) that is independent of the Brassicaceae At-α paleopolyploidization;** 
- **2) Cleome and Arabidopsis share the At-β duplication, which is lacking from papaya within the Brassicales; and**
- **3) rates of molecular evolution are faster for the herbaceous annual taxa Arabidopsis and Cleome than the other predominantly woody perennial Rosid lineages.** 

> These findings contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of genome duplication and evolution within one of the most comprehensively surveyed clades of plants, the Rosids, and clarify the complex history of the At-α, At-β, and At-γ duplications of Arabidopsis.**

- #### [Phenotypic variation, functional traits repeatability and core collection inference in Synsepalum dulcificum (Schumach & Thonn.) Daniell reveals the Dahomey Gap as a centre of diversity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76103-4)


[Complete chloroplast genome of Synsepalum dulcificum D.: a magical plant that modifies sour flavors to sweet](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23802359.2020.1798299#:~:text=Synsepalum%20dulcificum%20D.,-belongs%20to%20the&text=dulcificum%20is%20158%2C463bp%2C%20the,were%20annotated%20in%20the%20S.)



> Synsepalum dulcificum D. belongs to the Sapotaceae family (Shi et al. 2016), commonly known as miracle berry, miracle fruit, magic fruit, miraculous or asaba (Coronel et al. 2009; Obafemi et al. 2017), which is an evergreen shrub native to tropical West Africa (Wang et al. 2011). It is a kind of magical plant that has the unique characteristic of modifying sour flavors to sweet (Du et al. 2014). It is also a well-known natural source of ‘miraculin,’ a sweetening glycoprotein (Tchokponhoue et al. 2019). All plant parts of S. dulcificum are of medicinal importance. The berry fruit and leaf contains many nutrients along with many beneficial characteristics (Nkwocha et al. 2014; Njoku et al. 2015). It has the ability to improve insulin sensitivity, and antioxidant and anticancer abilities (Swamy et al. 2014). Thus, it may be used as an adjuvant for treating diabetic patients with insulin resistance (Chen et al. 2006; Obafemi et al. 2017). The seed oil of S. dulcificum is also a rare and exotic fruit oil (Guney and Nawar 1977).
As a valuable plant species, currently, S. dulcificum is utilized in cosmetics and food. Besides, it is also used extensively in the pharmaceutical industry (Achigan-Dako et al. 2015). Surprisingly, there are few studies on the genomics of S. dulcificum, focusing on the nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplast genome, which severely limits its utilization and breeding. In this study, the chloroplast genome of S. dulcificum was sequenced, assembled, and annotated firstly.






- 2015 [Current knowledge and breeding perspectives for the miracle plant Synsepalum dulcificum (Schum. et Thonn.) Daniell](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10722-015-0225-7)

> Synsepalum dulcificum, an African native shrub, is a valuable species. All plant parts are of medicinal importance whereas the fruit known as magic berry, miracle berry, or sweet berry is consumed fresh. Surprisingly, very little is known on the species in terms of genotypes utilization and breeding. In this review we recalled the uses and importance of the species and suggested research avenues for an accelerated growth and fruit production. Synsepalum dulcificum is rich in glycoprotein and is an excellent natural sweetener and also a good candidate for the synthesis of drugs against diabetes. Furthermore, S. dulcificum has high content in phytochemical substances (e.g. (+)-epi-syringaresinol, vanillic acid, cyanidin-3-monogalactoside, and quercetin-3-monogalactoside) with various health and food benefits. Data on the nutrient content are limited. Likewise, knowledge on the reproductive biology and mating system is still narrow, combined with poorly developed horticultural practices. To fully exploit the potential of S. dulcificum prospective actions include: (1) improving the propagation and growth abilities of the species, (2) improving knowledge of floral biology and genetic diversity, (3) understanding the phenological phases of the species, gene expressions and how this contributes to metabolites accumulation and (4) improving genotypes for beverages, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries and other value chains.



**Ecology and distribution**

> The miracle fruit is an African native species (Bartoshuk et al. 1974; Huang et al. 2012). Precisely, it originated from west tropical Africa and likely from the country complex consisted of Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Nigeria (Inglett and May 1968). Some characteristics of a plant described in Ouidah (6°21′N, 2°4‴E) since 1724 by travellers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and that are similar to the miracle fruit ones might indicate Benin as the real centre of origin (Juhé-Beaulaton 1998) while Swenson et al. (2008) indicated Ghana as the centre of origin. The species has afterwards been introduced in the USA, Australia, and Asia. The plant behaves well in warm, wet to humid environment, partial shade on well-drained acid substratum with pH varying from 4.5 to 5.8. The species does not tolerate alkaline conditions and water-logging (Milhet and Costes 1984). In Benin, the species is often cultivated in home gardens and fields in southern Benin (Akoègninou et al. 2006).


**Phytochemical properties and medicinal uses**

> The miracle fruit is an important source of phytochemicals. All plant parts are phytochemical-rich. The fruit is a source of miraculin that is effective in controlling human obesity when orally administered at a concentration of 10–7 M. The miraculin can also be used either in solid or liquid form in pharmaceutical industries (Henkin and Giroux 1974). The fruit is also a natural source of ficumone (R*)-4-hydroxy-2-oxetanone (Longchamp 1977), a clear oil which in the past was synthetically prepared (Hanessian and Girard 1994). The methanolic extract of the root revealed the presence of N-trans-feruloyltyramine, N-cis-feruloyltyramine, N-trans-feruloylmethoxytyramine, N-cis-feruloylmethoxytyramine, p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, methylparaben, vanillic acid, isovanillic acid and syringic acid (Chen et al. 2010). P-hydroxybenzoic acid and paraben are synergetic with enterocin KP to inhibit activities of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium in food (Yildirim et al. 2014) whereas vanillic acid is reported to have protective antioxidant activity when applied at high rate (Masson 2014). Through chromatographic separation, the methanolic extract of S. dulcificum leaves revealed presence of eight compounds including a mixture of β-sitosterol and stigmasterol, pheophytin-a, pheophytin-b, lupeol, lupenone, lupeol acetate, and α-tocopheryl quinone among which major ones are beneficial for health. For instance “lupeol” is reported to exhibit antiprotozoal, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, cardioprotective, antimicrobial, and hepatoprotective activities (Singh et al. 2014). Similarly, the methanolic extract of the stem was reported to contain six pure compounds namely: propane-1,2,3-triol; 2,5-dimethoxyphenol; 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid; nicotinic acid; β-sitosterol, and stigmasterol (Cheng et al. 2012). Those phytochemicals, especially for β-sitosterol, and stigmasterol, exhibit anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, antipyretic and immuno-modulating activity in animal (Sharma et al. 2014).

Synsepalum dulcificum stem is the only natural source of 2,5-dimethoxyphenol (Cheng et al. 2012). Based on a spectroscopic analysis, Wang et al. (2011) identified from the stem 13 bioconstituents including: dihydro-feruloyl-5-methoxytyramine; (+)-syringaresinol, (+)-epi-syringaresinol, 4-acetonyl-3,5-dimethoxy-p-quinol, cis-p-coumaric acid, trans-p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid, veratric acid, N-cis-feruloyltyramine, N-trans-feruloyltyramine, and N-cis-caffeoyltyramine. From those compounds, (+)-syringaresinol and (+)-epi-syringaresinol were reported to have anti-aging and anti-oxidative activities and to inhibit human skin cancer cells. Similarly, (+)-epi-syringaresinol, 4-acetonyl-3,5-dimethoxy-p-quinol, cis-p-coumaric acid, trans-p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, and N-cis-feruloyl-tyramine by reducing mushroom tyrosinase activity have a great potential to inhibit melanin synthesis and then can be used in hyper-pigmentation treatment. Major anthocyanin compounds include red pigments such as cyanidin-3-monogalactoside, cyanidin-3-monoglucoside, cyanidin-3-monoarabinoside, delphinidin-3-monogalactoside and delphmidin-3-monoarabinoside and yellow pigments (flavonols) such as quercetin-3-monogalactoside, kaempferol-3-monoglucoside, and myricetin-3-monogatactoside (Buckmire and Francis 1976). Red pigments are used as food colorant.

The phytochemicals richness in S. dulcificum was recently confirmed by Du et al. (2014). According to the authors the miracle berry is also an important source of phenolic and flavonoids with metabolites content varying along with the plant parts used. The total phenolic content is significantly higher in fruit flesh (1448.3 mg GA Equiv/100 g) than in the seed (306.7 ± 44.1 mg GA Equiv/100 g fresh weight)) and the total flavonoids content is approximately three times higher in fruit flesh (9.9 ± 0.5 mg of QR Equiv/100 g fresh weight) than in the seeds. Total phenolic and flavonoid content are two widely used antioxidant capability indicators (Xu 2012). In addition to its high ascorbic acid content, a total of nine phenolic acids, three anthocyanins, three tocopherols and one carotenoid were identified in the fruit flesh (Table 3) showing that S. dulcificum is qualitatively as well as quantitatively more rich in phytochemical compare with others antioxidant-rich berries such as Vaccinium corymbosum L., Rubus fruticosus L., or Fragaria spp. (Du et al. 2014). Furthermore, an ABT (2, 20-azino-bis (3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) assay revealed effectiveness of the miracle fruit flesh extract in inhibiting toxic lipid oxidation production. Owing to those properties, the flesh extract of S. dulcificum could be a suitable alternative to synthetic food antioxidants and by the same way prevent from chronic diseases associated with lipid metabolism problem. In investigating S. dulcificum effects on the induced insulin resistance, Chen et al. (2006) showed that the species fruit powder has the ability to improve insulin sensitivity and could thus be of importance in diabetic patients treatment or serve as alternative sugar for diabetic patients. Another interest in this natural sweetener is the prevention of carcinogenesis risks that are associated to artificial sweeteners such as cyclamates and saccharin (IARC 1980). Similarly, in a mice-based model, it has been showed that when mixed with Averrhoa carambola L., Carica papaya L. and Cucurbita maxima Duchesne fruit powders and suitably orally administered, S. dulcificum fruit powder exhibited anti-fatigue properties as well as an improvement of immune function (Huang et al. 2012).

> Miracle fruit (Synsepalum dulcificum) is an understudied tropical fruit species with potential as a source of natural, non-caloric sweetener. Miracle fruit berries have been consumed in Africa for over 100 years. The fruit pulp contains a protein called miraculin, a natural, non-caloric sweetener, that changes the perception of sour foods and beverages to sweet. Demand for natural, non-caloric sweeteners like miraculin is increasing due to the growing number of people affected by chronic diseases associated with high sugar consumption. Miracle fruit could play a role in reducing sugar content in some food and beverage applications, but basic plant yield data and miraculin content in the fruit is generally lacking.
